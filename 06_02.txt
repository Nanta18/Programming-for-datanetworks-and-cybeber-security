2)
a)  sudo -u dncs-db psql
b) \c
c) I used:

CREATE TABLE purchases (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, "last name" VARCHAR(255), "year of birth" INTEGER, "time of purchase" TIMESTAMP);
id was the primary key

d)
Because I clearly canâ€™t read I did not in fact do it by hand but used 2h to troubleshoot automatically adding it from file.

\copy purchases(id, "last name", "year of birth", "time of purchase") FROM 'data.txt' DELIMITER ';' CSV HEADER
This is how I got it to work.

e)
SELECT *
FROM purchases
;

f)
SELECT *
FROM purchases
ORDER BY "time of purchase" DESC 
LIMIT 3;
